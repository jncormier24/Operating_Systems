Finish off 9.3 to get into more details of the UNIX scheduling strategies. Explain and compare what is going on in Figure 9.17 with Figure 9.16. \\
The two major differences between what's happening in Figure 9.16 and figure 9.17 is the in 9.17 the system is using a round robin scheduling scheme, and takes into account user input. \\

Problem 9.11 \\ 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[a] Because there are two pointers pointing at the same process, the process will get twice the attention
	\item[b] The advantage to this scheme is that the more important jobs would get more attention
	\item[c] Enable multiple quantums, assigned to different levels of priorities. \\
	
\end{enumerate}
Problem 9.13 \\
This is a reasonable policy because it ensures that no one process will hog all of the processor time.\\

Problem 9.14 \\
This strategy favors an I\/O bound process because and I\/O bound process is less processor intense.
