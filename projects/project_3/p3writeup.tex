\section{Critical Section}
The critical areas are the areas where the car leaves the stoplight for the tunnel. The cars can only leave the stop light if it is green, and the tunnel isn't blocked.

\section{Mutual Exclusion}
The mutual exclusion is provided by condition checking.

\section{Buffer Length}
I believe the 6 minute buffer length is optimal.
